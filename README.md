# one bulletin

A mini-project using django.

Aggregates news headlines from several news media RSS feeds.

This is a work-in-progress. The app is currently configured to only access specific news feeds every fifteen minutes to update a database. A selection form for the webpage to filter news stories and multiple time zone support are yet to be implemented.

The app is currently [hosted on Heroku](https://one-bulletin.herokuapp.com/) and uses a PostgreSQL database.
